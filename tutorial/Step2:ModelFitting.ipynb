    "To fit a model on the tutorial data, we use the `fit-model` command of the `ddw` package. Sometimes, the commandline output is not properly displayed in Jupyter notebooks, so you might want to run the command in the next cell in the commandline rather than here.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** In this tutorial, we fit the model for 1000 epochs. However, reconstructions from earlier epochs should already look good. In our experiments, we found that although the fitting and validation loss continue to decrease with more epochs, the reconstructions are often relatively stationary after a certain number of epochs. \n",
    "You may want to check reconstructions during model fitting using intermediate checkpoints (see `Step3:TomogramRefinement.ipynb`). You can control the frequency of saving intermediate checkpoints using the `save_model_every_n_epochs` option of the `fit-model` command. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:**  On our system with a single NVIDIA L40 GPU (46068 MiB memory), an AMD EPYC 9334 CPU with 128 logical cores and 252 GB CPU RAM, fitting the model for this tutorial for 1000 epochs took approximately 14.5 hours. The time taken to fit the model will vary depending on the hardware you are using. "

It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file. Please open an issue on GitHub for any issues related to this experimental feature.\n",
